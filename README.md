# virtual-assistant
A virtual assistant, also called an AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.

Required packages and libraries-
pip install JarvisAI
This is the latest virtual assistant module, created by me. It provides the basic functionality of any virtual assistant. The prerequisite is only Python (> 3.6).
